My Career Transition Journey

I left a demanding job in medical nursing and began to think deeply about what I could do with my experience.
To be honest, I felt confused about my place in society. I only had a nursing license and had never worked in an office, so my skills and knowledge didn’t seem useful in a typical company setting.

I was disappointed in myself because I felt that the decade I spent working so hard might not be valued outside of the hospital. I started to wonder whether I had anything meaningful to offer beyond nursing.

While working temporary jobs, I kept searching for a new path for myself.
One day, I learned about a program run by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government that trains people to become IT engineers.
I was desperate for a breakthrough, so I jumped at the opportunity.
It was a six-month program designed to help complete beginners pursue a career in engineering.

I know that you cannot become an engineer in just six months.
Real engineers have reached their positions after years of demanding study and continuous effort.

If I heard about a program that promised to turn someone into a fully competent nurse in only half a year, I would be furious.
I would feel devastated, wondering what my own long struggle had meant.

I never expected the path to be easy.
But if I was going to commit to it, I wanted to give it my best.
I wanted to find a way to break through my current situation.
With that determination, I started the program.

Among all the subjects, the database lectures fascinated me the most.
I found SQL genuinely exciting, and as I explored more, I discovered that there are roles in data analysis where these skills can be used.

The process of digging deeper, thinking carefully, and understanding the story behind information felt strongly connected to my experience as a nurse.
When caring for patients, I spent over ten years learning how to interpret detailed — and often ambiguous — information to decide on the best care.
I looked beyond physical symptoms and tried to understand what was causing their suffering.
Those analytical and observational skills were something I had developed through my nursing career.

I have only just begun studying, and I know I am nowhere near the level of professionals yet.
But I am determined to keep learning step by step, and I finally feel that I have found a path where my past experience and my new skills can come together.

I created this page simply to record the path I have taken and the efforts I have made along the way.
